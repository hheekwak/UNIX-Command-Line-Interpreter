p2.c
 
Description: The program was a step-by-step project that imitates a simple command line interpreter for our UNIX system - step 2 (Program 2), and several enhancements like pipe line use and dealing with meta characters, "#" and "!" are added - step 3 (Program 4). Before step 2, getword.c (Program 1) was built as preliminary work. getword.c splits and defines a word from input and returns the number of characters of the word. The entire work was part of CS 480 Operating Systems course assignments at San Diego State University. 

It was referred to CS480 Class note and many questions are answered by Professor John Carroll. "https://fascination-euna.tistory.com/201" is consulted for better understanding the concepts.

Other than that, I, Hyunhee Kwak, wrote the code files (p2.c, getword.c, p2.h) myself.

For use of "history" array (for Program assignment 4), intentionally it is used from index 1 to index 9 for convenience: to match the order number - !1, !2, !3 etc. and index). 

Thank you.
